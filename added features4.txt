Efficiency:
-------------
[DONE]a timing comparison is done between efficient function zoom in, zoom out, fit-center, stretch, invert
gray scale functions, and  their alternative efficient new implemented ones. 
each function when called using its Control event, a timer is set, and ellapsed time is printed 
on the form label.


Image Processing:
------------------------
[DONE] fit and center : was implemented by implicit c# member function in Bitmap class, now i implemented in details to show how i do it.
[DONE] stretch: was implemented using the bitmap member function also of resizing, now it is done my way.

also added image processing functions:
[DONE]thresholding
[DONE]Edge detection
[DONE]image segmentation

Medical specific image processing: functions - CT images' data extraction
[DONE]1- Histogram drawn, and simple data extracted.



Testing & Debugging:
------------------------------
[DONE]tested all events in different orders, and used exeptoin handling.


Usability:
--------------
[DONE]Plus the clear GUI, I added a famous feature to the program:  undo/redo  up to 100 actions.
using array data structure and object oriented feature : aggregation



GUI:
------
[DONE]1- folder browser when creating new image
[DONE]2- color browser when choosing to draw line or draw by free hand


Coding:
----------
[DONE]Self documented.
